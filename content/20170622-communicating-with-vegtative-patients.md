Imagine if you were completely conscious but couldn't move or speak?
[Neuroscientist Adrian Owen](http://www.owenlab.uwo.ca/) has been
using brain-imaging techniques to detect consciousness in patients who
are presumed to be vegetative, sometimes for many years. By giving
simple commands and then measuring brain activity, Owen has learned
some patients are completely aware despite being entirely unable to
communicate or move their limbs.
