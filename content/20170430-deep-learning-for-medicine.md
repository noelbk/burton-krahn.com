Machine learning has made great strides in the last few years, and
[Convolutional Neural Networks](
http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) have demonstrated
some very impressive results in image and speech processing.  There
are some great opportunities to apply them to healthcare, but there
are some significant challenges too.

Regulatory approval requires a deeper understanding of the network
than just black boxes, and there is new mathementics being developed
to do just that.

Despite the challenges, devices based on neural networks have recently
been granted FDA approval, and there are many startups emerging in
this space.
